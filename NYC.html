    <h1>NYC Collision Analysis</h1>
    <p>This Excel-based NYC Collision Dashboard reveals 238,421 total collisions, with driver inattention, failure to yield, and unsafe speed as major factors, peaking in spring and during afternoon hours. Insights suggest prioritizing motorist and pedestrian safety through targeted awareness, better crossings, and hotspot interventions.</p>

  <h2>The Road to Safer Streets: Unraveling NYC's Collision Chronicles</h2>


    <h3>Mapping the Mayhem and Unveiling the Mission</h3>
    <p>
      Envision New York City as a pulsating metropolis where millions navigate a web of streets. Still, hidden dangers lurk in every turn, collisions that claim lives, cause injuries, and disrupt daily rhythms. This NYC Collision Dashboard acts as a vigilant sentinel, aggregating data from 2021 to 2023 to spotlight patterns in 238,421 total collisions, 116,226 injuries, and 635 fatalities. The purpose is lifesaving vigilance: by dissecting when, where, why, and how accidents occur, city planners, policymakers, and residents can pinpoint vulnerabilities and craft targeted interventions. Behind these stark numbers lies a human story of preventable tragedy, driven by urban density, traffic behaviours, and seasonal shifts, all aimed at forging safer pathways for a city that never sleeps.

    <h3>Navigating the Data Lanesâ€”Patterns, Meanings, and Insights</h3>
    <p>
      At the dashboard's core are the headline figures: 238,421 collisions resulting in 116,226 injuries and 635 fatalities, filtered by boroughs like Bronx or Brooklyn. These totals underscore NYC's high-stakes mobility, where even minor incidents cascade into major human and economic costs, meaning a single collision can ripple through healthcare systems and families. The insight: Prioritising borough-specific hotspots (e.g., via the location filter) could reduce overall numbers by 10-20% through localised enforcement. 
      </p>
        <p>
      The monthly vs. yearly trend line reveals a downward trajectory: peaking at around 10,000+ monthly in mid-2021, dipping to lower levels by 2023, with year totals of 110,545 (2021), 103,780 (2022), and 24,095 (2023), which is noted as incomplete. Year-over-year changes show a -6.1% drop from 2021 to 2022, then -76.8% to 2023 due to partial data. This pattern signifies progress, possibly from post-pandemic traffic reductions or safety initiatives like Vision Zero, but the incomplete 2023 data warns of potential underreporting. Insight: Sustaining this decline requires ongoing monitoring; extending data collection could reveal if 2023's low is a true win or artefact, guiding investments in tech like AI traffic cams.
    </p>
    <img src="images/NYC Analysis3.PNG" alt="Sales Trend" class="responsive-chart" />
    <p>Peak months highlight seasonal spikes: June 2021 (10,608 collisions), March 2022 (9,791), and March 2023 (7,981), aligning with warmer weather and increased activity. The meaning: Human behavior amplifies risks during transitional seasons, as people shed winter caution. Insight: Launch timed campaigns, like spring awareness drives (as recommended), to curb these peaks, potentially averting thousands of incidents by educating on weather-related hazards.</p>
    <p>Top 10 contributing factors expose behavioural culprits: Unspecified (59,549 collisions, 30% of dangerous ones), Driver Inattention/Distraction (58,308, 39%), Failure to Yield Right-of-Way (16,555, 64% noting percentages may reflect a subset of high-risk crashes). Others include Following Too Closely (15,519, 40%) down to Other Vehicular (6,494, 31%). These numbers mean preventable errors dominate, with distraction alone rivaling unspecified causes, pointing to modern distractions like phones. Insight: Enforcement and education targeting top factors, e.g., stricter distracted driving laws could slash 30-40% of collisions, as these human elements far outweigh mechanical failures.</p>
    <img src="images/NYC Analysis4.PNG" alt="Sales Trend" class="responsive-chart" />
    <p>Weekly vs. time interval collisions table shows daily/ hourly rhythms: Fridays rack up the highest totals (37,496), with peaks in 12 PM-4 PM (8,455 on Fridays) and 4 PM-8 PM (8,512 on Wednesdays), while Sundays lag (31,201 total). Early mornings (12 AM-4 AM) see fewer (e.g., 5,710 on Sundays). This reflects commute and leisure patterns, rush hours breed chaos, weekends offer respite. Insight: Optimise traffic management during weekday afternoons, like adaptive signals or remote work incentives, to flatten these peaks and enhance flow, reducing injury-prone bottlenecks.</p>
    <img src="images/NYC Analysis5.PNG" alt="Sales Trend" class="responsive-chart" />
    <p>Collision impact by role breaks down victims: Motorists suffer most injuries (81,428) but fewer fatalities (268), cyclists 10,932 injuries/73 fatalities, pedestrians 18,877 injuries/286 deaths. The meaning: Vulnerability varies; pedestrians and cyclists bear disproportionate lethality due to exposure. Insight: As suggested, focus on motorist-pedestrian conflicts with more crossings and bike lanes; this could halve pedestrian deaths, aligning with Vision Zero goals by protecting the most at-risk.</p>
    <img src="images/NYC Analysis6.PNG" alt="Sales Trend" class="responsive-chart" />
    <p>Seasonal collisions confirm spring's peril (64,028), followed by summer (57,752), winter (61,179), and autumn (55,462), with the highest peak in spring. Weather and activity surges explain this; thawing roads invite speed, but slips persist. Insight: Seasonal safety launches, like infrastructure checks in spring, could mitigate 10-15% of annual collisions by addressing weather-specific risks.</p>

     <h3>Steering Toward a Safer Horizonâ€”Lessons and the Path Forward</h3>
    <p>As NYC's collision narrative unfolds, the dashboard paints a tale of declining dangers amid persistent threats: from distraction-driven crashes to seasonal spikes, claiming 635 lives and injuring over 116,000. The overarching insight? Data-driven action targeting behaviours, times, and vulnerabilities holds the key to acceleration toward zero fatalities. Why it matters: In a city of 8 million, these patterns aren't just stats; they're calls to safeguard lives and economies. With incomplete 2023 data hinting at progress, the story urges continued evolution: bolster enforcement, infrastructure, and awareness to transform NYC's streets from battlegrounds to beacons of safety. </p>
