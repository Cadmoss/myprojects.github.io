											 <a>Project Background</a>
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>With over five years of experience in the automobile industry, I've developed a deep appreciation for the role that data plays in vehicle safety, performance, and consumer confidence. Out	of sheer curiosity and a passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights, I decided to explore publicly available vehicle data, which led me to an extensive dataset on vehicle recalls from Data.gov.</p>
										<p>To bring clarity to this rich dataset, I started by importing the raw data into Excel, where I applied various data cleaning techniques. These included functions like TRIM, TEXT, PROPER, IFERROR, SUBSTITUTE, and CLEAN, among others, to standardize and structure the data for analysis. Once the dataset was clean and consistent, I imported it into SQL to run queries and uncover deeper trends, patterns, and correlations that are difficult to capture in spreadsheets alone.
										After gaining these insights, I moved the data back into Excel to build an interactive and visually compelling dashboard. The result is the dashboard presented here, a detailed U.S. NHTSA Vehicle Recall Analysis spanning from 2000 to 2025.</p>
										<p>What stood out most during this analysis, and what makes this project both timely and important is the alarming volume of unresolved vehicle recalls in the United States. With over 893 million affected vehicles still unresolved, the data paints a concerning picture of recall management and highlights a critical area of focus for manufacturers, regulators, and consumers alike.
 										This project not only showcases the power of combining Excel and SQL for data storytelling but also emphasizes the real-world impact of data in enhancing vehicle safety and accountability in the automotive industry.</p>

									<h3>Cumulative Impacted Vehicles 
										</h3>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Analysis 1.PNG" alt="" style="width: 600px; height: auto;" 
</a></a>							<p>Over a 25-year span, the analysis reveals a staggering total of 894,349,439 M vehicles impacted by recalls in the United States. This figure represents the cumulative number of vehicle units affected by safety-related recalls reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) between the year 2000 and May 2025.</p>

									<h3>Unresolved Recalls: A Concerning Industry Reality 
										</h3>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Analysis 2.PNG" alt="" style="width: 600px; height: auto;" 
</a></a>

								<p>One of the most striking insights from this analysis is the overwhelming volume of unresolved vehicle recalls reported between 2000 and May 2025. Out of an estimated 894,349,439 potentially affected vehicles, only 1,046,020 have been marked as completely resolved â€” a figure that equates to just 0.12% of total cases. This means a staggering 99.88% of all recalled vehicles remain unresolved. </p>
								<p>What does this mean?</p>
								<p>Unresolved does not always mean unaddressed, but it often points to recalls that have not been formally closed out in the system, either due to lack of vehicle servicing, owner inaction, or gaps in the follow-up process.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/Analysis 3.PNG" alt="" style="width: 1000px; height: auto;" 
</a></a>
									<P>The line chart on the dashboard provides a month-by-month view of recall activity btween the year 2000 - May 2025, and a notable pattern emerges: May, January, and October recorded the highest number of affected vehicles in that year.</P>
									<p>Why these Months might be higher</p>
									<p>While the dataset does not dirrectly explain the cause, several industry-related factors could contribute to these peak months such as:</p>
									<p>Regulatory Reporting Cycles</p>
									<p>New Model Year Launch Audits</p>
									<p>Internal Quality Reviews</p>
									<P>Weather-Related Testing Outcomes</P>
