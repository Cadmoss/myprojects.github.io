      <img src="images/Health7.PNG" alt="Product Performance" class="responsive-chart" /></p>
      <p><b>The insight?</b> This data reveals a system sensitive to time-based trends, suggesting a closer examination of staffing and resource allocation to mitigate these peaks and troughs.
      As the story reaches its climax, the analysis delivers its revelations. The consistent decline across quarters and week types signals a potential need for strategic intervention. <b>Why?</b> It hints at external factors, such as reduced patient visits or policy shifts, that may impact revenue. The meaning behind the numbers is a call to action: the healthcare centre must adapt to maintain financial health amidst these downturns. <b>The insight?</b> Stakeholders should explore boosting weekend services, analysing seasonal drivers, and optimising departmental schedules to reverse the downward trend, turning this financial saga into a roadmap for resilience and growth in the face of change.
      </p>
      <h3>Medical Metrics Providers</h3>
